# Installation from release #

To install from release, extract the downloaded release file, call configure, make and make install.

    > tar xf libextant-0.1.tar.gz
    > cd libextant-0.1
    > cd build
    > ../configure
    > make
    > make install

## Optionally generate docs ##

If you have Doxygen on the system, the docs can be generated with the docs target:

    > make docs

# Installation from source #

If installing from source, the autotools and libtool development environment is required, in addition to other tools that should be detected in the autoconf phase.

    > git clone https://github.com/jcastillo2nd/libextant.git
    > cd libextant
    > autoreconf --install
    > cd build
    > ../configure
    > make
    > make check
    > make docs
    > make install
